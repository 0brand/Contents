# Qubes-Community #
Here you can find the Community guide's, doc's, & wiki's. Furthermore you can also raise feedback discussions in the issue tracker.

### Caution before use ###
We, as in any Qubes-Community users, collaborators, members and owners, expect that anyone using anything produced, uploaded, adviced or otherwise, that comes out of the Qubes Community, to be met with a healthy amount of skepticism. Please be careful about running any scripts, following wiki's, doc's or guide's, which you don't understand what do. We take no responsibility for any damage or losses. We do however wish to keep the reliability, as well as security and privacy, at the best quality possible, but we are not accountable for not meeting our goals.

This site is run by volunteers. The Qubes OS Project is not affiliated with this site and does not endorse the content of any of these pages.

### Community doc's ###
All doc's here have the potential to one day become an official Qubes doc. Be mindful that they are still not perfect, and you must be careful when using them.
- Once Community doc's has been processed, they will appear on this list.

<br />

### Commuinity wiki's ###
The centralized and all published decentralized github wiki's can be found here.

### Commuinity Script's ###
Here you can find the community scripts. Their states will be listed, put into three categories, these are Alpha, Beta, & Stable. Alpha state means it's untested, not finished, or requires reviews. All scripts will always start out as Alpha state. Stable means it's been tested, reviewed, and is deemed safe to use, however, the above disclaimer at the top of this page still applies. Beta is somewhere in-between, it's getting there, but is not deemed quite stable yet either.

### Community project's ###
These are extensive works which incorporate multiple of inter-connected scripts and coding, problems which also may require their own issue tracking lists, as well as a larger collaboration of community developers. Community project's hold a repository on their own.
- [Qubes-A.I. ](https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Qubes-A.I.) - Offline & Open Source, initially Voice Control only. Project is fresh and require hands to speed it up.
- [Qubes-NAS](https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Qubes-NAS) - Securing your NAS systems. Project is fresh and require hands to speed it up.
- [QubesTV](https://github.com/Qubes-Community/QubesTV) - Securing your SmartTV. Project development has started, extra hands are welcome.

More projects to come as volunteers start them up. A project must go beyond the complexity of a script/guide, and involve complexity of inter-connected scripts, issue tracking, long-term development and updates, or other reasons that justifies it to become a project.

<br />

### Community guide's ###
Guides are not doc's which has the potential to reach the official Qubes doc's page. Instead guides are meant for more pure community oirentated how-to's. For example how to style your system to make it look better, or suggestions for how you can help contribute to the Qubes Community.

 - [Qubes Styling - XFCE4 w/ Launchers]() - Coming soon.
