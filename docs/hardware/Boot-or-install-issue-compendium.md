## List of currently not written content ##
_Feel free to add to this temporary short-list_
- For example hardware Controllers that are tied down by other relevant hardware, causing issues when isolating controller.
  - For example touchscreen/graphicard/sound-card beeing tied to the USB controller, means USB controller cannot leave dom0.
    - This can for example cause Qubes to behave strangly, be unable to use certain hardware, or even straight outright kernel panics. 
  



## Developer notes, may be deleted once out-dated or when doc is finished ##
- This doc is heavily inspired by the IAQ doc.
- This doc may go well together with the hardware selection tree guide/doc.
- This is really only a sketch to get it rolling, right now almost everything is doc concept. Feel free
