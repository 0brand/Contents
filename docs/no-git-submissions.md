A shortcoming of the official [qubes-doc](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/) is that basic git knowledge is [required](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/doc-guidelines/) to contribute: concepts like forking a repository or understanding pull requests have to be mastered, as well as synchronizing a forked repository with upstream for subsequent contributions.

Qubes users who don't want to learn git for a reason or another, or who don't feel confident submitting a pull request (PR), can simply create an issue in this github community page ("Issues" tab above) with any content they deem fit: documentation (new or improvements), suggestions, fixes,  one-liners, ... 

Once the issue's content is discussed in the issue's thread and is in shape for a PR submission (whether to this project's unoffical documentation or to Qubes' official repository), a community member will either create a git pull request on your behalf and will take care of anything "git", or guide you in creating your own PR. Note however that in the former case attribution/credit cannot be assigned to you, it is a technical shortcoming of having a pull request created and submitted on your behalf.

It would of course ease the burden on community members if returning contributors learn the few basic git steps required to submit pull requests themselves, but this is of course not a requirement.
