A shortcoming of the official [qubes-doc](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/) is that basic git knowledge is [required](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/doc-guidelines/)) to contribute (concepts like forking a repo, understanding pull requests, ... have to be mastered, as well as synchronizing an upstream repository for later contributions).

Qubes users who don't want to learn git for a reason or another can simply create an issue in this github community page ("Issue" tab) with any content they deem fit: documentation (new or improvements), suggestions, fixes,  one-liners, ...

Once the issue's content is discussed in the issue and is deemed OK, a community member will create a git pull request on your behalf and will take care of anything "git". Note that attribution/credit cannot be assigned to you, it is a technical shortcoming of having a pull request created and submitted on your behalf.

It would of course ease the burden on members if returning contributors learn the few basic git steps required to submit pull requests themselves, but this is of course not a requirement.
