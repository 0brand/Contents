#### Contributing without knowing git

A shortcoming of the official [qubes-doc](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/) is that basic git knowledge is [required](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/doc-guidelines/) to contribute: while git command line isn't necessary, concepts like forking a repository or understanding pull requests have to be mastered, as well as synchronizing a forked repository with the official repository for subsequent contributions.

Qubes users who don't want to learn git for a reason or another or who don't feel confident submitting a pull request (PR) can simply create an issue in this github community page ("Issues" tab above), with any content they see fit: addition or improvements to documentation, suggestions, tips, typo fixes, one-liners, ... 

After (optional) discussion in the issue's thread and if the content is deemed fit for submission (whether to this project's unoffical documentation or to Qubes' official qubes-doc repository) a community member may either create a git pull request on your behalf and take care of anything "git", or if you'd like to, he could guide you in creating your own PR. Note however that in the former case attribution/credit cannot be assigned to you - it is a technical shortcoming of having a pull request created and submitted on your behalf.

It would of course ease the burden on community members if returning contributors learn the few basic git steps required to submit pull requests themselves, but this is of course not a requirement.
