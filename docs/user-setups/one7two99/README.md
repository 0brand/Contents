My setup of Qubes
=================
this document will describe my Qubes Setup and what I did to improve the Qubes experience so that Qubes will become my daily main operating system


About Me
--------
I am working for a Berlin based IT Solution Provider. Main topics datacenter infrastructure (Cisco/NetApp/Vmware/Microsoft).
Working with Linux and even more with Qubes adds some complexity, as several internal workflows but also customer projects are mainly relying on windows software and operating systems.
Using Qubes has been a decision as I want to prove that another world is possible and because I want to keep my data as much secure as possible.
Additionally I Qubes offers protection when working with one device in several customer environments.
