### Workflows

#### 'Issues to pull requests'

- a user creates an issue with content/suggestion/... in the 'contents' repo
- if needed, initial discussion about the content happens in the issue
- if the issue is deemed OK, a reviewer (actually any user) creates a PR to one of the following repos and then closes the issue with a link to the new PR.
    - the official qubes-docs
    - project's forked qubes-doc
    - the project's 'content'
- further discussion - if any - happens in the PR.
- if the issue is not deemed fit for inclusion in any of the repos, the issue is closed indicating the reason of the content/suggestion/... rejection
