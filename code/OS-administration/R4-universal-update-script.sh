# Title description:
## Universal Qubes Update Script (UQUS).

# Quick purpose overview:
## This script performs auto-updates of dom0 and every default template, as well as any templates
## you may wish to add. The script is straight forward and highly customizeable. 

# >>>>WARNING!<<<<
## Please read the script carefully, do not run if you do not know what it does.
## Be sure you edit it correctly to your own needs.

# >>>Disclaimer!<<<
## I take no responsibility for use of this script, please study it before you use this script at your own risk. 
## However I gureantee and stand by the ideal and belief to improve the quality and reliability as far as possible
## within my capability and reach, and reasonable circumstances, such as being aware, and having the time to fix it.

# Feedback & Contributions:
## Feedback and/or new contributoers are welcome, please use QCC Pull Request, or feel free to contact me.

# Important usage notes:
##1) Be sure you have enough free RAM to run every updated template, all are run one at a time.
##2) The script will halt if it is interupted, such as not enoguh RAM, errors/logs are currently not reported.
##3) VMs will proceed and shutdown automatically if no updates, or after succesfull update install.
##4) You may include the -y option to auto-accept updates in some VMs, be careful though.
##5) Add or remove # in front of the command instructions to disable/enable commands.
##6) Its essential to keep dom0/templates in sync between repositories, don't mix current and current-testing.
##7) Only use current-testing if you know what you are getting yourself into (untested updates).
##8) This script release version is only tested on Qubes 4.0, but presumably may work on Qubes 3.2.

# To-do notes:
##1) Further streamline script, making it easier to customize with symbolic links.
##2) Reducing the risk that users mistakenly run testing, or out-of-sync dom0/template updates.
##3) If feasible, presenting the logs for each update, saved in a dated folder for every time script is run.
##    - If feasible, reporting errors and logs to the user during or after the update has finished.
##    - If succesful, it removes one of the two major concerns of including the -y attribute, making it easier to use.
##4) - (Done) Investigate whether --clean can be removed or changed from the dom0 update command.
##5) Investigate the feasibility of a simple GUI interface to select or de-select script script-options (possibly long-term).
##6) Fixing the progress bar, and picking the best approach to inform the user.
##7) A better means to stop the script pre-maturely but safely, because it is a long chain of events to update all VM's.
