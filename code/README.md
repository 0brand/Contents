### User-contributed code (scripts, programs, ...)

Note: linking to contributors' public pages (github, gitlab, plain web page, ...) is preferred over hosting (otherwise contributors have to submit PRs to update their *own* code because of the lack of granular write privileges on github - this is cumbersome and requires reviewer time to ack PRs).


**`dom0/`** - things meant to be run in dom0

- qvm-copy-to-dom0: copy files to dom0 (moving files to dom0 is dangerous and discouraged though)
- R4-universal-update-script.sh: unattented template update (whonix, ...)

**`multimedia/`**

- sound-control-scripts: toggle, volume up, volume down, ...

**`productivity/`**

- toggle-fullscreen-scripts
- screenshot-scripts
- bash autocompletion script for `qvm-*` commands in dom0

**`server/`** - using Qubes OS as a server

- see server/README.md
