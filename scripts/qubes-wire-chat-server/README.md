### Qubes Wire - Chat server ###
Work is being done to prepare a guide to set up a Wire server on a Qubes sytem, to maximize secure chat, while still having features akin to Whatsapp, Skype and even Discord. Wire is open source, for client as well as server, however uses a similar business-model where they offer free 1:1 uses, and a small fee paid version for group features. 

Wire is end-to-end encrypted on the client side, even if you don't use a trusted server, the client is still in your control, and the encryption and keys are handled in your client, not on the Wire server.

You may use your phone number, however it is not required, you can also use your e-mail or an anonymouse e-mail. Wire is very flexible, and tries to respect your freedom, open source and your human rights.
Similar they do not endorse datamining, but instead relies on businesses and groups to pay a small fee, in roder to stay in business.

This is very speculative, however it should be noted that their business-model is very new, they might have to review how to survive if the income isn't high enough to cover costs.
