### Qubes sound control scripts
Here you may find various of different kinds of Qubes sound control. Some work in other *nix operation systems, but others are Qubes specific, for example volume control of specific AppVM's. (More will be uploded later).


### Caution before use ###

We, as in any Qubes-Community users, collaborators, members and owners, expect that anyone using anything produced, uploaded, adviced or otherwise, that comes out of the Qubes Community, to be met with a healthy amount of skepticism. Please be careful about running any scripts, following wiki's, doc's or guide's, which you don't understand what do. We take no responsibility for any damage or losses. We do however wish to keep the reliability, as well as security and privacy, at the best quality possible, but we are not accountable for not meeting our goals.
